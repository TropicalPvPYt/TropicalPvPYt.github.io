# The Basics

In this game you are the red dot and you have to time your clicks in order to climb the levels and to reach the top. To complete a level you have to reach the top of your screen, each levels will become harder and quicker. LEDs will constantly move and move faster as the levels go on. However after each ap you pass through there will be a rest zone where there won' be any LEDs on that row. You click A to move forwards and you click B to move backwards. You click 0 to move left and you click 1 to move right.

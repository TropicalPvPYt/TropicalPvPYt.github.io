In today's lesson we looked at the consequences of what you post, not only does it affect your life forever but it can also affect other people's life. The video we watched is called 'First to a Million' ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqLFAYeYVbQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqLFAYeYVbQ)) and you had to choose an option and depending on what you choose your future will be different. We also talked about why certain people’s blog posts weren't working, they weren't working due to ‘human error’.

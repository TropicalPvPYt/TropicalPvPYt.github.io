Todays lesson we looked at the messages in adverts, and who their target audience was and what the message was, for example, there was a KIA car advert ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DIvRKPsHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_DIvRKPsHU)) and we looked at how the advert was designed to be for a target audience of young people. Then we looked at the text, this was the story line which was that the hamsters were fat and were getting fitter. Then we looked at the subtext, this was the message in it and the message was:

Your good, but you can be better.

We also looked at a work sheet where we had to fill in who did what. E.g. Josh has twitter. ([https://drive.google.com/a/challoners.org/file/d/0B48EaMutZcj1OGpmUlpzWG1INzQ/view](https://drive.google.com/a/challoners.org/file/d/0B48EaMutZcj1OGpmUlpzWG1INzQ/view))

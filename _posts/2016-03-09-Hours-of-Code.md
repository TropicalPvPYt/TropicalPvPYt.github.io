Todays lesson we looked at various computer flash games that involve code. My favourite one was[ http://lightbot.com](http://lightbot.com/) because I found it very user friendly and challenging still in places. I also liked playing[ http://codecombat.com](http://codecombat.com/) and how you have to right the code yourself (e.g self.moveDown). In the lesson I managed to finish[ http://lightbot.com](http://lightbot.com/) and do all the levels. In today's lesson Mr Keen wasn't teaching, instead it was Miss Collis.

**Lesson 3 Homework**

Name:Harvey

Assignment: How can your current or future social media activity affect your goals and aspirations for the future or how you want to be when you are older?

You can focus your response on things you have posted (if you use social media) that you might reconsider posting or deleting in the future. You can also focus on ways you have used or would like to use social media in positive ways that can help you with your future education, hobby, or career goals.

Once you click 'Upload', there's no going back. When you apply for some jobs they check all of your previous internet history, for example, if you apply to be a teacher, if in your past you have posted any photos or videos that could be considered "threatening", then you will not get the job. There are hundreds of videos on youtube of people who got declined their jobs because of their history on social media. Like I said before, when a photo, video or message is uploaded, even if you delete it,  it will still be there. All it takes is one click of a button for your message to be screenshotted or even worse, printed. So be careful what you post because you will never get it back.

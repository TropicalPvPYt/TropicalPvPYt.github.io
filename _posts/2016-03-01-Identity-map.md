Creating my identity map was really fun, i enjoyed the colouring and having to think about stuff to put on it. I felt fine sharing my identity map with the class because I only put stuff on which I didn't mind people knowing, but when i looked at other people's identity map I started to think that mine was a bit bare and didn't have that much writing. I really enjoyed commenting on other people's identity maps and I liked the idea of being anonymous and writing it because that's what happens in real life and it teaches you a bit about the content you should be posting. I also though would rather be told my statements directly as I could contradict them and make the question answer rethink his idea. I was very surprised when i read through my comment because I was getting really nice comments, normally online you tend to get 'hatersâ€™, but luckily I only had nice comments and the occasional improving suggestion. I think because you know the person who you are commenting on in person, you tend to put nicer comments as they could maybe work out what you wrote. Making the identity map made me think more about posting online and how you should put as much effort as you can into what you post. From this exercise, I want to go back and improve some stuff i've posted on social medias and improve what i'm going to post in the future.

Overall these 6 lessons have had an impact on me and I have learnt:

* Put more effort in your work.

* People act differently when they're behind screens.

* some social media rules/recommendations.

* how harmful social media when you post the wrong things

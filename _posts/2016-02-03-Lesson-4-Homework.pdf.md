**Lesson 4 Homework**

Your Name: Harve Russell

Assignment: Interview a family member or friend, someone that uses social media. Let them know their responses will be shared with your class. Have them review or recall their own social media pages online and then answer your questions. You may have to remind the person you are interviewing to speak slowly so you can write down what they are saying. You may also have to ask them to repeat sentences. It is okay to summarize what they are saying for this assignment, rather than recording every single word they say.

Name of person you interviewed:Zak

Interview Questions:

1. What social media sites do you use?

Facebook

2. What do you think others would say about you solely based on what you post online? What would they say about the kind of person you are and what your interests are?

They would see that i'm a very private person as i don't tend to post things about my private life. They would see that i go running and fishing from my bio.

3. Is there anything you would want to change about your online identity? Anything you want to share more or less online? If so, why?

With regards to my online identity i feel that we give too much information away and it's important that you use your privacy settings in order to restrict access to other people.
